Welcome on the official AFF3CT documentation {#mainpage}
========================================================

**AFF3CT** is an **Open-source software** (*MIT license*) dedicated to the **Forward Error Correction (FEC or channel coding) simulations**. It is written in **C++11** and it supports a large range of codes: from the well-spread **Turbo codes** to the very new **Polar codes**. The support of the **Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes** is under development. A particular emphasis is given to **the simulation throughput performance** (hundreds of Mb/s on today's CPUs) and the portability of the code.

You can get the code source from the **GitHub repository**: [https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct](https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct).

If this is your first time in **AFF3CT** you should read [the compiling guide](md__home_adrien_workspace_HPC_aff3ct_README.html).
